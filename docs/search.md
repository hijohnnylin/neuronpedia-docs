# Search

### What do we mean by "search"?

Neuronpedia supports **searching** all the features of an SAE Set, which **runs inference on arbitrary text through the model to get the top features that activated on that text**.

### Example Search

Here's an [example search](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small/?sourceSet=res-jb&selectedLayers=[]&sortIndexes=[]&q=Charles%20Dickens%27%20%27Great%20Expectations%27%20skillfully%20weaves%20a%20tale%20of%20personal%20growth%20and%20societal%20critique%2C%20as%20young%20Pip%27s%20journey%20from%20humble%20beginnings%20to%20the%20complexities%20of%20London%20society%20reveals%20the%20illusions%20of%20wealth%20and%20class.) of the SAE Set `RES-JB`, using a sentence about the book Great Expectations.
