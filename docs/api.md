# API and Exports

## API

[The API is a work-in-progress and will be more fleshed out in the coming days.]

Neuronpedia has a public API to access all of its data, including features, explanations, activations, and more. You can find the API documentation and test the API directly in your browser here: [https://neuronpedia.org/api-doc](https://neuronpedia.org/api-doc).

## Exports

For your convenience (and to avoid hammering our server), we have full data exports here:
[https://neuronpedia-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=v1/](https://neuronpedia-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=v1/)

### Older Exports

If you're finding something is still missing, please [email us](mailto:support@neuronpedia.org) - we're usually able to export the data to you within 48 hours.
