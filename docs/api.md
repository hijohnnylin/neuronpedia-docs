# API and Exports

## API

[The API is a work-in-progress and will be more fleshed out in the coming days.]

Neuronpedia has a public API to access all of its data, including features, explanations, activations, and more. You can find the API documentation and test the API directly in your browser here: [https://neuronpedia.org/api-doc](https://neuronpedia.org/api-doc).

## Exports

For your convenience (and to avoid hammering our server), we have full data exports available for some SAEs here:

[https://neuronpedia-exports.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html](https://neuronpedia-exports.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

We are gradually exporting the other SAEs. Please let us know if you need a specific export by [emailing us](mailto:support@neuronpedia.org) - we're usually able to export the data to you within 48 hours.
