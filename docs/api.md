# API and Exports

Neuronpedia has a public API to access all of its data, including features, explanations, activations, and more. You can find the API documentation and test the API directly in your browser here: [https://neuronpedia.org/api-doc](https://neuronpedia.org/api-doc).

If you'd like to access a large amount of data (>50,000 features), we ask that you please request a data export from us instead, instead of sending many requests, which may cause more strain on our servers and performance issues for other users. You can just [email us](mailto:support@neuronpedia.org) for a data export - we've done many of these and we're usually able to export the data to you within 48 hours.
