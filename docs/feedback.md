# Feedback & Support

There is nothing we like more than fixing bugs and implementing your feature requests. We want to make Neuronpedia as smooth and as useful as possible, so please be send us your most ambitious feature requests and ideas. And of course we'll credit you with these ideas (if you'd like).

You can [email us](mailto:support@neuronpedia.org) or ping us on [#neuronpedia in the Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/opensourcemechanistic/shared_invite/zt-1qosyh8g3-9bF3gamhLNJiqCL_QqLFrA) to get a quick response.

We're excited to hear from you!
